Description:
In this project, I extracted industrial production index data from TurkStat (TÃœÄ°K - TÃ¼rkiye Ä°statistik Kurumu), applied preprocessing techniques, and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

I leveraged storytelling techniques from Analyst Academy to enhance data visualization and interpretation. 
The analysis focuses on understanding trends, seasonal variations, and economic impacts on Turkeyâ€™s industrial production from 1986 to 2024.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps:
- Data extraction and preprocessing
- Trend and seasonality analysis
- Outlier detection and impact assessment
- Comparing calendar-adjusted vs unadjusted indexes
- Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy
